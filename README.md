# Huffman Coding Project

This project centers around the implementation of Huffman Coding, a file compression algorithm, in C++. The primary focus is on compressing and decompressing text files, emphasizing the delicate balance between achieving lossless compression and exploring the distinctions between fixed-length and variable-length encoding.

## Key Features:
- Compression and decompression of text files
- Robust implementation in C++
- Emphasis on lossless compression
- Exploration of fixed-length and variable-length encoding nuances
